Task: FutureInterns ‚Äì Task 2



## Project Overview
This project simulates the activities of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.  
It involves monitoring security alerts, detecting suspicious activities, and drafting incident response reports based on simulated log data.

## Tools Used
- Splunk (Free Trial) for SIEM log analysis
- Custom SPL queries for detection
- Sample SOC logs (`SOC_Task2_Sample_Logs.txt`)

## Key Tasks
- Detect multiple failed login attempts
- Identify malware signatures (Trojan, Rootkit, Spyware, Worm, Ransomware)
- Analyze potential privilege escalation attempts
- Draft structured incident reports
- Recommend remediation actions

## Deliverables
- `üîê Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response Simulation Report.pdf`  
  (Full incident response report with findings, analysis, and recommendations)  
- `SOC_Task2_Sample_Logs.txt`  
  (Log dataset used for Splunk queries and analysis)

## Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with SIEM monitoring and SPL queries
- Understanding of SOC workflows: detection, analysis, response, and reporting
- Practical exposure to cybersecurity incident response processes
